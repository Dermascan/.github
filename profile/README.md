## 📜 **Abstract**

Skin lesions refer to abnormal changes in the skin's appearance, texture, or color, often indicative of underlying medical conditions. A crucial differentiation in skin lesions is whether they are **malignant** or **benign**. Alarming statistics suggest that **1 in 5 Americans** will develop skin cancer in their lifetime, where timely diagnosis can be life-saving. However, pre-screening costs—ranging from **$100 to $200**—can deter people from seeking early detection, leading to increased health risks. 

Our project explores the use of **hyper-parameter optimization** in **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to enhance the accuracy and accessibility of **self-assessment tools** for detecting skin lesions. We hypothesize that optimizing hyper-parameters in **Multimodal CNNs** will improve mean accuracy in identifying skin lesion subtypes. 

### 🔬 **Findings**:
- Using optimized CNN models, we achieved a **mean accuracy of 94.5%** for detecting skin lesion subtypes.
- Unoptimized CNN models had a lower accuracy of **85.7%**.
- We also compared our results with two competing CNN classifiers:
  - **Classifier A**: **84.4%**
  - **Classifier B**: **80.8%**

These findings confirm that hyper-parameter optimization significantly improves classification performance.

### 📱 **Implementation**:
We integrated our optimized CNN model into the **Derma Scan app**, offering **free-of-cost skin lesion assessments** for users seeking to self-assess and classify skin lesions. This tool provides a cost-effective, accessible alternative for early skin cancer detection.

## 🚀 **Conclusion**:
Our research demonstrates that hyper-parameter optimization in CNNs offers a powerful, low-cost solution for skin lesion detection, enabling widespread access to early screening tools.
